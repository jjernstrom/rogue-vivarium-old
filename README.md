# rogue-vivarium

Experiments in building a simple rogue-lite in a virtual ecosystem.

## Overview

A **rogue-lite** is a game that some characterize as a [Procedural Death Labyrinth](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/on-procedural-death-labyrinths) that makes strong use of procedural generation, a strong player-character death penalty, and takes place in a semi-contained environment.

A **vivarium** is literally a "place of life" and commonly understood as: "an area, usually enclosed, for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivarium)).

This project seeks to combine the two concepts as a laboratory in procedural generation techniques, agent-base modeling, and user interaction in 2D space.
